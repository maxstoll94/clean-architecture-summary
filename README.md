This is my personal summary of the Clean Architecture book written by Uncle Bob

# Chapter 1: What is Design and Architecture

- `The goal of good software architecture is to minimize human resources required to build and maintain the required system.`

The signs of a mess (bad architecture) are when increasing the number of developers results in a small 
or non-existent growth of code and productivity. The end result is frustration: Executives have higher payrolls for marginal output in productivity and
developers work hard, but have to focus all their efforts into managing the mess to implement small features.

A comparisom to Aesops story of the `Tortoise and the Hare` is drawn. In which developers are in a constant race but exhibit overconfidence in the ability to remain productive: `We can clean it up later; We have to get to market first`. However, market pressure is relentless and continuous and there is no time to go back and clean things up. Developers who accept the lie that `Writing messy code makes a developer go faster in the short term` are experiencing the overconfidence of the hare. In the end: `Making messes is always slower than staying clean, no matter which time scale you are using`. To resolve decline in productivity, developers need to stop thinking like the hare and take responsibility of the mess they have made. 

Note: Often a proposed solution is to start over, this is a sign of overconfidence and will most often result in a similar to mess to the original project.
